39. type below command:-
	docker images --help
Now, try to run command that proves the concept of following three options:-
1. -a
2. -f
3. -q

write atleast 1 command using each option above and prove their concepts as described in the --help.
Ans-
1. docker images -a ---> Show all images
2. docker images -f ---> Filters output based on conditions provided.
3. docker images -q ---> It only shows the Image IDs

40. type below command:-
docker ps --help
Now, try to run command that proves the concept of following six options:-
Ans-
1. -a - (docker ps -a) ---> Shows all the containers(all).
2. -f - (docker ps -f) ---> Filters output based on conditions provided(Filter).
3. -q - (docker ps -q) ---> It only shows the Container IDs(quiet).
4. -n - (docker ps -n) ---> Show n last created containers(last int).
5. -l - (docker ps -l) ---> Shows the latest created container(Latest).
6. -s - (docker ps -s) ---> Shows the size of total file(size)
